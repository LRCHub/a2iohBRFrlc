It ain't over
From the open speech 'till the curtain falls
Days and nights spent repeating your lines, the play is still on

It ain't over
Just 'cause you say so
Are you rushing your way out, is it a drag to leave it undone?

'Cause it ain't over
There's enough room to turn
Don't think about it, just walk out
Don't let them fool you

It ain't over
Wake up focus again
The greatest crimes come with a not, they will read it aloud to the gathering crowd
That it ain't over...

It's the way it goes without breaking the silence
What the matter with you have you lost your mind
You are here now... you are here now

Long before the words that you learned as a child, before any single monster that you locked down below
You are here now... you are here now
You are here now.
