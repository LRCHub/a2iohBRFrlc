# Fujii Kaze – It Ain't Over

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
if you were gone
I would not feel so sad
cuz deep down I know
no one will ever be gone
you may say, this is the end
like I never was your friend
and you go so far away
that's when you hear me say
boy it ain't over
over, yet
it ain't over
over, yet
oh, we'll all go back to the same home
the deeper I dive
the more I'm sure
you're still by my side
wherever I go
my life's been good
it's time to go
bye-bye my friend
but you know, in time
we all gon' realize
that it ain't over
over, yet
it ain't over
over, yet
oh, we'll all go back to the same home
and they say, nothing ever stays the same
but with faith, we find something that will
never change
it ain't over
over, yet
it ain't over
over, yet
oh, we'll all go back to the same home
see you soon, we'll all go back to the same home
home
home
