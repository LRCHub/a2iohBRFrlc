```lrc
[00:25.95] if you were gone
[00:30.44] I would not feel so sad
[00:37.70] cuz deep down I know
[00:42.23] no one will ever be gone
[00:50.15] you may say, this is the end
[00:55.53] like I never was your friend
[01:01.93] and you go so far away
[01:07.31] that's when you hear me say
[01:11.08] boy it ain't over
[01:15.24] over, yet
[01:23.34] it ain't over
[01:27.28] over, yet
[01:35.21] oh, we'll all go back to the same home
[01:55.68] the deeper I dive
[02:02.03] the more I'm sure
[02:07.68] you're still by my side
[02:13.40] wherever I go
[02:19.85] my life's been good
[02:22.41] it's time to go
[02:25.92] bye-bye my friend
[02:31.90] but you know, in time
[02:37.04] we all gon' realize
[02:41.21] that it ain't over
[02:45.25] over, yet
[02:53.41] it ain't over
[02:57.48] over, yet
[03:05.17] oh, we'll all go back to the same home
[03:14.50] and they say, nothing ever stays the same
[03:23.50] but with faith, we find something that will
[03:29.95] never change
[03:59.53] it ain't over
[04:03.33] over, yet
[04:11.31] it ain't over
[04:15.37] over, yet
[04:23.18] oh, we'll all go back to the same home
[04:35.39] see you soon, we'll all go back to the same home
[04:45.51] home
[04:48.82] home
